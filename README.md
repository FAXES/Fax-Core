**Fax Core By FAXES**

**About**
Today I present to you a new script that is so diverse and unique, it's one of a kind. This is Fax-Core, a permission system to blacklist certain groups from things from vehicles to ped models, and it all uses Ace permissions. Yes no database, no editing tons of files to add groups etc. 

With Fax Core you have 3 administration and 4 user ranks, each with their own set of permissions (all groups are outlined below). With the base of Fax Core you can whitelist; vehicles, peds and weapons for specific groups. Eg: Senior admins can not use the owner vehicle but people with the owner permission can. Below is a list of features and videos on setting up and a highlight video.
